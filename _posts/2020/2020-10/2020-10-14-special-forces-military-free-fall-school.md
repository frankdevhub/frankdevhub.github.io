In the season two premiere of Coffee or Die, Marty Skovlund, Jr. travels to the U.S. Army JFK Special Warfare Center's Military Free Fall School in Yuma, Arizona, where special operations service-members are taught how to get to the battlefield clandestinely and safely to conduct operations against our nation's enemies.  

The Military Free Fall School encompasses four distinct courses: the Basic Parachutist's Course, the Jumpmaster Course, the Advanced Tactical Infiltration Course (ATIC), and the Instructor Course. In this episode, Marty takes a first-hand look at all four courses, and how they each play a part in creating warfighters who are capable of inserting into any location on earth via military free fall techniques. 

In a Coffee or Die exclusive, Marty was even able to interview an active duty special operator who conducted a classified combat free fall mission in Afghanistan in 2009. This is one episode you won't want to miss!
